# filebotology
A bash script to autosearch for subtitles on a Synology NAS

## Requirements
  * Filebot
  * Java ARM

## Installation
  1. Instal Java for ARM architecture from here. Note that we will require Java 8; as of this writing, ver 8 is not supported directly from Synology package (it's stuck at ver. 7). Therefore, download and install manually from [Oracle official page] (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-arm-downloads-2187472.html).
  2. Go to Package Center, and install Filebot from community package list
  3. Also fromthe community packages, install git to ease the download of the script itself
